# Tips

## Custom AI Composer

follow [Prompt Override](/customize/prompt-override), the AI Composer can be customized. in the `prompt/code` folder, 
you can create a file named `sketch.vm` to override the composer prompt.

## Use RipgrepSearch

Since we don't have a full-text search feature, you can use `RipgrepSearch` to search for files in the project. You can install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install ripgrep
```

Then you can use it in the AutoDev Composer.
